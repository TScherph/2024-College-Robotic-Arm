# College-Arm-2024

This is a continuation of my freshmen design project, myself and one other person have decided we want to take this project forward and see what we can create. 
Our goal is to successfully create a 3d printable modular prosthetic arm and attachments. We are using esp32 microcontrollers to communicate control across the entire arm, the arm will be split into major components, the hand, the wrist, the forearm, the elbow, the bicep and the shoulder. Each part will have a universal magnetic adapter that allows it to connect to any opposite end anywhere on the arm. If you wanted to have a forearm that was twice as long, simply add another. This allows us to create a prosthetic mount that you can interchangebly attach what you need at the time with as much ease as possible.
We also created a control glove that uses flex sensors and a gyroscope to communicate control data.
